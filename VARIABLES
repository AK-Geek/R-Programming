# A variable is a fundamental concept used to store and manage data. 
# It is like a container that holds a value, and you can give it a name to reference that value. 
# Variables are essential for working with data and performing operations in programs

#there are some rules to write your variables
  # 1) you can only use "letters", "numbers", "_", "."
  # 2) variables should begin with letters not with numbers or underscore or dot
  # 3) Variables are CASE-SENSITIVE that means "name" and "Name" are diffrent variables

#There are diffrent types to create and assign value to variables with "=", "->" and "<-" they are explain as a code in line 12 11 and 13

var_1 = "FIVEOPEDIA"
var_1 -> "FIVEOPEDIA"
"FIVEOPEDIA" <- var_1

generally in R we only use var_1 -> "Fiveopedia" .

#FINDING A VARIABLE

  ls() is the command which is use to print all the variable we have in our workspaceand to find any specific variable we use print(ls(pattern="var")) it find all the variables which has var present in there name

#DELETING A VARIABLE

  Variables can be deleted by using the rm() function for example,

    rm(var_1) #it deletes var_1 can be checked using
    print(var_1) #it shows error as it has been already deleted
