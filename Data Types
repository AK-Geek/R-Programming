#R is a dynamically typed language, which means that the data type of a variable is determined automatically based on the value assigned to it. 
#R provides several fundamental data types, and here are some of the most commonly used ones:

1) Numeric: This data type represents real numbers. It includes both integers and floating-point numbers.

Example:

x <- 12    # Integer
y <- 3.14 # Floating-point

2) Character: Character data type represents text. You can create character variables by enclosing text in single or double quotes.

Example:

name <- "Fiveopedia"

3) Logical: Logical data type represents binary values, which can be either TRUE or FALSE. It's often used for conditions and Boolean operations.

Example:

is_analyst <- TRUE
is_aesthetic <- FALSE

4) Factor: A factor is a categorical data type used for nominal and ordinal data. It's represented as a vector of predefined labels or levels.

Example:

gender <- factor(c("Male", "Female", "Male", "Female"))
## NOTE c() IS USED TO CREATE VECTORS OR ARRAY IT STANDS FOR COMBINE OR CONCATINATE

5) Integer: In addition to the general numeric data type, R has a specific data type for integers, which can be useful for memory efficiency .

Example:

count <- as.integer(10)

6) Complex: The complex data type represents complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts.

Example:

z <- 2 + 3i

7) Date and Time: R provides data types for date and time. For example, Date and POSIXct represent dates and timestamps.

Example:

birthdate <- as.Date("1990-05-15")
timestamp <- as.POSIXct("2023-11-06 10:30:00")

8) Vector: A vector is a one-dimensional array that can hold multiple values of the same data type. R's most basic data structure is a vector.

Example:

numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

9) List: A list is a collection of objects that can be of different data types. Lists are versatile and can hold various types of data.

Example:

person <- list(name = "Fiveopedia", age = 23, is_analyst = TRUE)

10) Data Frame: A data frame is a two-dimensional table-like data structure that can hold different types of data. It's commonly used for working with structured data.

Example:

df <- data.frame(name = c("FIVEO", "PEDIA"), age = c(25, 30))
